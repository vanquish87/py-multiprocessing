Multithreading is useful for IO-bound processes, such as reading files from a network or database since each thread can run the IO-bound process concurrently. 

Multiprocessing is useful for CPU-bound processes, such as computationally heavy tasks since it will benefit from having multiple processors; 

similar to how multicore computers work faster than computers with a single core.
